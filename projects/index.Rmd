# BIOL 3100 Final Project

## Background:

Several years ago I started a Facebook meme page, [Philosophical Gym Bro](https://www.facebook.com/GymKingSadBoi) with my friends Ben and David, a BYU Business/Stats major and a UVU Philosophy/Psychology major. The idea behind this project is to analyze the data provided by the Meta business suite for the page. After a slow start we have had much more success than we ever anticipated. It was meant to be, and still is, a fun little intellectual meme page about whatever topics we were interested in at the time. It has since become a moderately sized entity in Facebook's intellectual meme community. We just passed 10,000 followers in March.

The question I am most interested in exploring is about the importance of original content (OC). How successful is OC in general compared to shared content? Is it more likely to go viral? Most of the content on almost any social media platform is re-shares/re-posts. My original thought for this project was influenced by an article I once read that talked about how a website (Tumblr, I think) had a 10:1 ratio of original content to re-shares. That was years ago and I can't find the article anymore. [Here's one](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/new-study-shows-that-25-of-twitter-users-produce-97-of-all-tweets/610146/) showing something similar going on with Twitter. The way memetics have developed since 2015 or so make it seem like this isn't news anymore. It's just the way that social media works now.

Within the Facebook meme community there is a certain importance placed on OC produced by pages. Production of OC shows that a page is an actual producer of memetic content, which is:

1. Run by actual humans.

2. Those humans have some amount of creativity, sense of humor, insight, etc.

For our purposes we are not interested in levels of originality in OC. Obviously Kurzgesagt and True Facts are more original and respectable than someone making let's plays, but we can't easily quantify that. OC will here be defined as anything modified in some way by a human.

### AI Tangent:

It did not occur to me earlier, but AI is going to have a very strange effect on these communities. Memetic spread has often been based on references heaped on injokes heaped on references. Now that AI can already generate its own memes, the value of incredibly topic specific memes that only humans can make will gain a lot of importance.

Edit: This is troubling.

```{r}

```

Not only does this meme work, but it's meta. More importantly it's funny. These are, however, easy references using some of the most common meme formats. It is still quite worrying. Forget about automating jobs away, what will we do when the beep-boops are funnier than us? I have no mouth and I must meme.

## Metrics:

Meta Business Suite is the interface through which Facebook's pages are run. Zuckerberg being a benevolent and generous ruler, we have access to statistical data about our own page through the Insights tab of this interface. There is some information on audience and overall page performance, but the most detailed data we have access to is the performance metrics of our past posts. 

Some of these metrics have the same names as similar metrics addressing performance of pages as a whole. For example, "Reach" can mean total reach of page over a certain period, or the total reach achevied by a single post. I'm interested in individual posts, so unless stated otherwise, metrics are on the post level.

Also important is the fact that we do not pay to promote any of our content. This page has always been for creativity and fun. All these metrics can be considered "*organic*".

We also don't make videos/stories/reels which helps simplify things. We are only active on Facebook (although have been meaning to make an Instagram), so the Meta metrics only represent one website. There is no way to track memes being stolen or copy/pasted to other social media sites. I'm going to go ahead and completely ignore this very common practice, despite its obvious relevance to the analysis.

I don't completely understand how all of Meta's metrics are calculated. I will be using [this website](https://www.socialstatus.io/facebook-metrics/) as a reference.

In measuring the "*virality*" of posts, Impressions seems more important than Reach. I had not heard of Impressions before now, and Reach is often talked about as the gold standard. This may be a recent update. Facebook only started using Meta Business Suite about two years ago and has been constantly changing it since (while writing this I saw a notification for yet another update). 

Impressions seems more useful because, as a measure of unique users, Reach is not accounting for users who see certain memes over and over. Seeing something time and time again means users are more likely to engage with the meme or some mutation of it they particularly like. They are also more likely to reference the meme in conversation or their own posts. Although less interesting from a page admin standpoint, Impressions is better at showing social media *zeitgeist* relevance. 

Engagement is also very important. It is essentially a combination of all direct interaction with a post (clicks, likes/reactions, comments, shares, etc.) The importance of these sub-metrics to a post's spread is something like clicks < reactions < comments < shares. Shares is the most interesting because it shows both that a user liked the post enough to associate it with their account, and each share represents a new set of users exposed to the post. So I would say that shares indicate both engagement and *virality*.

## The Data:

I'm going to be looking at the data for our page over the course of 2022. During this time all three of us admins were engaged with the page and creating OC fairly consistently. We even had a few things go viral. Seeing your memes showing up in totally random places is incredibly validating. The page was already about 2 years old and had started to have some success, but was also quickly growing. This will provide a large data set, while also avoiding the odd statistics you can get at the very beginning of such projects.

The data provided by Meta has some annoying aspects to it. Let's get to cleaning.

My Facebook is in Spanish and so is the data. This is my own fault because I set a lot of my UIs to Spanish so I'm continually practicing. I am fluent, but I don't necessarily know what words/phrases correspond to what in Anglo-ish. Tech vocab is often not a direct translation. There are also occasionally words from Mexican or South American Spanish which I don't always recognize, or familiar words are used differently in those dialects.

Ex. I just figured out that "*interacciones*" is engagements, not interactions. A close, but not quite direct translation.

An even larger problem is the fact of vowels with tildes "`". I have no clue how to write those on an English keyboard. I typically just ignore them when typing in Spanish (a terrible and very common practice). Five extra letters in the alphabet are going to mess things up if the column names can't be referred to accurately in code.

Business Suite's Insights tab gives data in .csv format. That's good, but it only lets you download three months at a time. So we have four raw uncleaned .csvs representing all the page's posts over the course of 2022 split into quarters. A single dataframe would be much easier to work with.

### Cleaning:

The tidying process:

1. Read in .csvs

All four have 34 variables, so no trouble there.

2. Clean names

Gets rid of the tildes, capitalization, added underscores.

3. Append

We need a single df, so rbind appends all the observations together.

4. Select()

Most of those 34 variables Meta gave us are irrelevant or empty. We'll keep what has data, but even some of those probably aren't critical for us. Change order of columns to be a little less annoying too.

I have also translated the column names. Some descriptions are still in Spanish, but I don't think those will be a problem.

5. Separate date_hour variable

The date and time of of each post are different variables, both of which will likely be important.

The class of these two columns is still stuck on character and as.Date() is not cooperating. Will edit when I fix the problem.

6. New Variable: OC

We mark our original posts with "OC" (or some variation) in their descriptions, so we are going to need to make a new column based on the post descriptions. Unique() might help, but practically every description is unique.
Edit: Done. Add description.

### 2022 Data Frame

What we're left with is a single tidy df with 693 observations across 18 variables.

That means a total of 693 posts. Even between three admins an original meme every day is a lot, so right off the bat you know that OC:shares is almost certainly not 1:1.

Edit: Managed to get an OC variable. 101/693 posts are oc based on the tidying. Will make more figures exploring this later.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(GGally)

dfyear <- read.csv("./dfyear.csv")

dfyear %>%
  select(impressions,engagements,reach, shares) %>% 
  ggpairs() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

(Yes I know it's showing the stupid warning messages. I already set those to FALSE. I'm not sure why they're still showing up.)

That's a little hard to read with so many observations. It looks like there are 3 outliers consistently messing with things. Those probably represent our posts that went really viral. It looks like there is also a cluster of 5 or so posts that were also quite successful sitting behind them, but at the front of the pack.

The next step (besides working out the last bits of tidying) is probably to get a baseline of our usual post performance without, say, the top ten posts of the year.
Edit: Done besides the pesky date and time stuff.

Here's a quick histogram of the data so far. That top observation is actually an unmarked OC David made. Will need to go back through and check what is not marked correctly.
