My name is Austen Miller Aceituna.

(Just Austen Miller for Americans.)

I am a Bioinformatics major in the Honors program at Utah Valley University. I am interested in ecology, mycology, and plant microbiomes. I am currently a member of Dr. Geoffrey Zahn's [research lab](https://gzahn.github.io/lab/).

I am a dual citizen of the United States and Spain. I grew up in between Utah and Madrid. I speak English and Spanish(España), and am learning Portuguese(Brasil). I also enjoy alpine skiing and hiking. My favorite books are *Dune* by Frank Herbert and *Cien Años de Soledad* by Gabriel García Márquez.

I am also a founder and the science content contributor for the “Philosophical Gym Bro” [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/GymKingSadBoi/) & [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/philosophicalgymbro/) meme page.
